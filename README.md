# JavaScript Patterns with Real-World Applications in React

Welcome to **JavaScript Patterns with Real-World Applications**, a collection of common JavaScript design patterns demonstrated with practical real-world examples using React. This repository is a growing library of patterns, aiming to provide insights into how these patterns can be applied in modern front-end development.

## Introduction

JavaScript design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They help improve code readability, maintainability, and scalability. In this repository, we explore these patterns in the context of React development, offering real-world use cases and code examples.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

1. Demonstrate JavaScript design patterns in action.
2. Provide React-based examples that can be used in real-world applications.
3. Serve as a reference for developers looking to improve their coding practices and build better applications.

## Patterns Included

Here are the patterns currently featured in this repository (more to come):

1. **Factory Pattern**  
   _Example_: Dynamically creating components based on a configuration theme switcher.

2. **Builder Pattern**
   _Example_: Building a Pizza with different toppings, size, and crust.

3. **Adapter Pattern** (TBD)
   _Example_: Normalizing data from different APIs into a consistent structure for React components.

4. **Singleton Pattern** (TBD)
   _Example_: Managing a global state store using a singleton pattern with React Context API.

5. **Observer Pattern** (TBD)
   _Example_: Building a simple event subscription system for a React application.

6. **Module Pattern** (TBD)
   _Example_: Encapsulating reusable utility functions as modules in a React project.

7. **Strategy Pattern** (TBD)
   _Example_: Implementing different data-fetching strategies for React components.

8. **Decorator Pattern** (TBD)
   _Example_: Enhancing a React component with additional functionality using HOCs (Higher-Order Components).

9. **Adapter Pattern** (TBD)
   _Example_: Normalizing data from different APIs into a consistent structure for React components.

More patterns and examples will be added over time.
